# Sounds-like

[Website]()

## Name:
Ramadan Day at NYUAD

## Description: 
*what is the project, what is the overall concept and theme, and what kind of experience you were striving to create.*

In regards to the start of the Holy month of Ramadan, our project is a sound piece that takes you on a journey to experience a day in the life of an NYUAD student fasting during Ramadan. The Holy month of Ramadan is an important month to muslims, and as many students are away from home, celebrating the month is different than usual. The sound starts during sunrise, following the student throughout their day until they break their fast at sunset to create an experience of what it's like to fast during Ramadan.


## Process: 
*How did you go about implementing the concept.*

1. After deciding on the idea, we created a simple wireframe for our website. We decided to do 3 separate sections on the same page which we can scroll through. First the title section, then the sound, and lastly the credits. The sound is played through an iPhone to look at the day in the life of a student captured through a phone - the nostaligia from scrolling through pictures in your gallery brings sound to what you see. Our idea was to also have the first sound to be a phone alarm which was suitable with the iphone idea of waking up to the alarm for "suhoor".

2. We wrote down and divided the "scenes" of the whole day into 4 parts which was seperated into sounds, some of which we would record or retrieve online.

**Part 1:** Wake up for Suhoor (Salama)
- Alarm
- Suhoor eating sounds
- Adhan 
- Turning in bed
- [Silence]

**Part 2:** Class (Suman)
- Shower
- Door closing
- Walking
- Lift sounds
- Walking
- Distant sound of lectures / class
- [Zones out]

**Part 3:** Prayer sound (Zaeem)
- Talking friends â€“ explain class situation + time until Maghrib
- Walking Sounds to D2

 **Part 4:** D2 + Maghrib prayer (Ronit)
- D2 chefs + grill sounds 
- Cash register
- D2 Ambience + Eating
- Adhan

  
3.  We used the Zoom H6n to record some of the audios.
4.  Each of us took 1 part to edit, which we then put together into 1 sound.
5.  While recording, we also took pictures of each "scene" to add a slideshow of images while our sound plays.
6.  For the website we added interactivity by allowing people to play music on the front page and the confetti to pop up. We also added animations to our names on the last page.

**Wireframe:**

## Reflection/Evaluation: 
*This should bookend the initial concept and talk about whether your expectations and goals were met in the process of building the final working version.*

We definitely captured each of the moments that we thought defined an individual's day whilst fasting at NYUAD, this included working with D2 staff and asking our friends to partake in conversations. It was interesting to piece together the audio soundscape part by part as we all worked on it individually but it came together pretty well and the sounds are extremely clear to hear, including the reverb and fading effects. We also used the 'mono' effect of sound at some instants. The website also helps drive the Ramadan day idea home by really following through with the festivity themes and the music. If we could do this again, I think our story arch could be more definitive by introducing the protagonist earlier in the 'story'.
